<h1>MaVue: Easier Vue apps <small>inspired by Mavo</small></h1>



Vue.js is a great framework: it's blazing fast, and has a large community around it.
However, it requires a fair bit of JS knowledge to use.
Even for folks with that, certain things can be cumbersome and repetitive to implement.

MaVue is a modular collection of Vue helpers (directives, Vue components and Web components)
designed to make developing Vue.js apps
faster and approachable to a wider audience.
They can be used all together, or separately.

It is inspired by [Mavo](https://mavo.io), our earlier project for developing entire web apps by writing HTML.
We noticed that several of Mavo's individual functionalities were desirable for developers,
but Mavo is all-or-nothing and cannot easily be used in conjunction with another framework.
Furthermore, Mavo was designed primarily for novices, and its JS API was not as smooth as a JS-first framework.
With MaVue, we want to bridge this gap, and offer developers of all skill levels the best of both worlds.
